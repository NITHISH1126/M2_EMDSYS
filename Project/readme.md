# Floor cleaner

# Description
* Automatic floor cleaner is a system that enables cleaning of the floor by the help of highly stabilized and rapidly functionalized electronic and mechanical control system. 
Current project work targets to use automatic floor cleaner for large floor in house-hold purposes and office floors.This can be used on flat surfaces for cleaning

# Identifying Features
* Avoiding obstacles and path sensing using ultrasonic sesnor.
* Cleans the unwanted particles like dust,sand.
* Falling from stairs can be avoided by IR proximity sensor.
* Calculates the distance .

# Abstract
Automatic floor cleaner is a compact robotics system which provides floor cleaning service in
room and big offices reducing human labor. Basically as a robot it eliminates human error and
provide cleaning activity with much more efficiency. Also due to manual labor
involved this is time consuming and irritating to clean the floor. Also in big offices floor area is
very huge and the people involved there for cleaning purpose cannot clean it much more
efficiently. This is where the robot comes as an advantage. Also the robot is small and compact
in size.
