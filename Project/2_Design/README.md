# 6. COMPONENTS:
## 6.1 ATMEGA328P
	The ATMEGA328P is a popular microcontroller due to it being a major component in the Arduino board products. In this proposed project it is used as a major micro controller, it converts analog to digital and maps certain values. It controls potentiometer and LCD displays.
  
## 6.1.2 EEPROM
	The ATmega32 contains 1024 bytes of data EEPROM memory. It is organized as a separate data space.

## 6.2 POTENTIOMETER
	In this proposed project the potentiometer is used instead of temperature sensor. It is used to get the user input.

## 6.3 PUSH BUTTON
	Push button is used as a sensor in this proposed project. It is used for sensing whether the engine is started or not.

## 6.4 LCD
	In this proposed project, HD44780-1 LCD display is used to display the temperature of the engines heat.
  
## 6.5 COOLING FAN
 	It is used to cool the engine's heat and act as a actuator
