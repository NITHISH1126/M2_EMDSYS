## SOLAR ENERGY WITH TRACKING SUN

## INTRODUCTION
Solar energy is defined as the transformation of energy that is present in the sun and is one of the renewable energies.
With the current systems for solar energy harvesting, we have high production only at fixed times mostly noon.
This Study proposes a dual axis solar tracker system that increases the productivity by a significant margin.
